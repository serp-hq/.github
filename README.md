# 🐍 Serp-HQ

**Serp-HQ** is the home of the **Serpentes VM** and the **Garter dialect of Python**.  
We’re exploring the future of Python across environments — from servers to browsers — under one unified runtime.

## 🚀 Projects

### [Serpentes VM](https://github.com/serp-hq/serpentes)
A shared virtual machine for Python and Garter.  
- Defines a common bytecode and execution model.  
- Built on WebAssembly + native runtimes.  
- Provides built-in Serpentes RPC (`sRPC`) for browser ↔ server calls.  

### [Garter](https://github.com/serp-hq/garter)
A lightweight Python dialect for the browser.  
- Strict subset of Python 3.13 with safe sandboxing.  
- Adds browser-native modules: `dom`, `events`, `storage`, `server`.  
- Runs inside Serpentes VM for seamless client ↔ server integration.  

---

## 🧭 Mission
- Eliminate the “two-language problem” between Python (server) and JavaScript (client).  
- Standardize a **unified runtime** that works everywhere Python goes.  
- Provide a platform for experimentation, collaboration, and future PEPs.

### ⚡ About
Serp-HQ is not (yet) an official Python project. We are an independent community exploring ambitious ideas — together.
